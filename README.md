# NPS-Website
A National Park Service website from my web development course.

This project was during the later stages of the course. It includes use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some PHP.
The HTML page does not hold any actual information, but does display a few links and images.
The PHP login page does not access a database, though I later worked with MySQL to implement these capabilities.
The Guest page uses arrays from the JS data file to display the 50 States and their National Parks (including real URL) as a list.

** Things I would add **
- database access
  * add park function
  * remove park function
  * functional log in
- Update index page to display real information
  * news articles
  * navigation bar
- Make Guest park list more readable or presentable

Overall, this project was a great learning experience and I may revist this for practice.
